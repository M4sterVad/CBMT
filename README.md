Gamifizierte AAT - Masterarbeit Vadim


Abstract

The present work deals with the development and implementation of a mobile application sup-
porting the approach–avoidance training. In this work the approach–avoidance training targets

behavioural change of overweight and obese individuals in relation to their eating habits. Based
on the human-centred design for interactive systems, a usability-solution has been developed and
examined. The core feature of this application includes the game design elements points, praising
comments, performance graph and narrative. It has been investigated whether the use of these
game design elements will have a stronger impact on the psychological needs competence and
autonomy in terms of task relevance than an application without the aforementioned game design
elements. The result of the investigation turned out to be consistent with the hypothesis.
